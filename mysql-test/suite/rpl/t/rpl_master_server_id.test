#
# SHOW SLAVE STATUS can return the master_server_id.
# We add another method to get master_server_id:
#   select @@GLOBAL.master_server_id.
#
# master_server_id is an integer system variable.
# The default value is 0.
#
# It maintains the same semantics as SHOW SLAVE STAUTS;
# Each time the slave connects to master, it starts the slave
# IO thread and refreshes master information. The master_server_id
# is updated at that time and cached.
# STOP SLAVE, RESET SLAVE cannot reset the value (as in SHOW SLAVE STATUS).
# RESET SLAVE ALL will reset the value to 0.


--source include/master-slave.inc

# By default master server id is 1
--connection master
SELECT @@GLOBAL.server_id;
# slave should have the master_server_id since it has connected.
--connection slave
SELECT @@GLOBAL.master_server_id;
# Change the master's server_id.
--connection master
SET @@GLOBAL.server_id= 123;
SELECT @@GLOBAL.server_id;
# Note that the slave still caches the stale master_server_id.
--connection slave
SELECT @@GLOBAL.master_server_id;
# To update the master_server_id, you need to do a reconnect.
# As discussed, STOP SLAVE, RESET SLAVE should not clean the master_server_id.
--source include/stop_slave.inc
SELECT @@GLOBAL.master_server_id;
# master_server_id is refreshed when you reconnect the master.
--source include/start_slave.inc
SELECT @@GLOBAL.master_server_id;
# The only way to reset master_server_id to default is RESET SLAVE ALL.
